#### I'm working on:
- [ ] Control what's dropped when entity is killed
- [ ] New actions : item/block dropping - Money (Later)
- [ ] Prevent spam of the entity (per player) - (Thinking to use Tick number + Array NBT)
- [ ] Prevent spam of the entity (per Entity) - (Thinking to use Tick number)


#### I'm stuck on (Help needed):
- [ ] Looking for information about: Entity act as a Block (Collision, breaking ...)
- [ ] Is it possible to added floating effect to the entity ? (Like a cloud)
- [ ] Looking for help for the reload function. I've to use a Task, but i want a task that check ALL of my entity that need to be updated, and not a task per entity
- [ ] Looking to the right way to have the file CheckIn.php loaded


#### Known BUG
- [ ] Orientation of normal and small entity when created is 90째 instead of 45째 (Don't know how to fix now, will check later)
